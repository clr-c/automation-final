# Final Automation Exercise
## Automating Web College Manager with Pytest and Selenium

In this final exercise, we focus on automating the testing process for the [Web College Manager](<https://tdd-detroid.onrender.com/>) application using Pytest and Selenium. This project demonstrates how to efficiently test a web application, ensuring its functionality and performance meet the required standards.

# Requirements

* Python 3.12.3
* pip (24.3.1)
* [venv](<https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>) (recommended)

# Instalation

1. Download or clone the repository 
2. Open a terminal
3. Go to the project root directory "/tdd_detroid_pytest/".
4. Create a virtual environment: `py -m venv venv`
5. Activate the virtual environment executing the following script: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

# Test Execution

1. Open a terminal
2. From the project root directory run: `pytest tests/`

# Configuration

By default, tests will be executed in Chrome.

# Results

To check the recordings, open the '/recordings/test_recording.mp4' file once the execution has finished.
